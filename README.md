# flights_dataset_analysis

There are 8 folders in this repository from task_1 to task_8.

## Dataset
In this repository of "flights_dataset_analysis", we have worked on 2018 and 2019 flights, passengers, and fuel consumption data. 
Since the file was too large for GitHub, we decided to SQL each task's data and store it in a **google drive** folder. the link is provided in README.md of each task.

## Exploratory Ananlysis

There are 8 Tasks and each of them is in a separate folder. Inside each task's folder, you can find **(1)** a Jupyter notbook file (.ipynb) which contains the code and approach to getting the answer, **(2)** a README.md file that contains a google drive link of the .csv data used for each task.

### IMPORTANT NOTE:

PLEASE DO NOT touch/run the code of how we obtained the data in the beginning of each .ipynb file because you will get error.

This is because the data provided for this project is under supervision of [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca) and is only accessible to its students. Use the final data we obtained and saved in google drive.
